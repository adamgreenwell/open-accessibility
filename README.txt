== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin make my site fully WCAG compliant? =

This plugin helps improve accessibility and addresses many WCAG criteria, but complete compliance requires a comprehensive approach that includes proper content structure, image alt text, semantic HTML, and more. We recommend using this plugin as part of your accessibility strategy, not as a complete solution.

You can choose from four positions: left side, right side, bottom left, or bottom right of the screen. You can also customize the size and appearance of the widget.

= Can users hide the widget if they don't need it? =

Yes, there's a "Hide Accessibility Panel" option in the widget that allows users to hide it. It will remain hidden for 24 hours.

= Can I generate an accessibility statement for my website? =

Yes, the plugin includes a built-in accessibility statement generator that creates a statement based on your organization details.

= Does this plugin slow down my website? =

The plugin is designed to be lightweight and only loads what's necessary. The impact on page load times should be minimal.

= Can users save their accessibility preferences? =

Yes, all user preferences are saved using local storage in their browser, so settings persist between visits.
